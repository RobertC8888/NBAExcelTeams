# NBAExcelTeams - for Spring 2023

This is a working copy of my repo

Build with `.\gradlew build`

The Jar, when run, produces an Excel file that lists the basic information of every NBA Team

Optionally, the Jar can be run with an argument to specify the filename of the excel spreadsheet. If no argument, the default filename is "NBA Teams.xlsx"
